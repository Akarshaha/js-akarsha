HOW DO THE CODES GET EXECUTES IN JS

=>JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT
=>FUNCTIONAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
=>EVAL EXECUTION CONTEXT

*MEMORY CREATION PHASE
*EXECUTION PHASE
  
STEPS:
1.JS RUNS THROUGH GLOBAL EXECUTION/ENVIRONMENT AND ALWAYS IT  WILL LOCATE THIS KEYWORD
2. THEN IT CREATES MEMORY PHASE WHERE IT ALLOCATES MEMORY OF VARIABLES(UNDEFINED) AND FUNCTIONS(DEFINITION).
3. NEXT COMES THE EXECUTION PHASE HERE VARIABLES ARE INITIALIZED AND FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED
    WHENEVER A FUNCTION IS CALLED AGAIN NEW EXECUTION CONTEXT IS CREATED(NEW ENVIRONMENT + EXECUTION THREAD) HERE AGAIN IT CONTINUES THE SAME CYCLE OF MEMORY PHASE AND EXECUTION PHASE.
ONCE IT GOT EXECUTED NEW EXECUTION CONTEXT GOT DELETED.




Understand call stack with the help of live demo :
browser > inspect > Sources
1. then create a snippet by clicking on the arrow(>>) next to the workspace
2. then write down some functions in the created snippet, do save them by CTRL+S 
3. Create breakpoints AND, run the code and keep an eye on call stack to visualize how it works.
